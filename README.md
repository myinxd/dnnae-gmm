# DNNAE-GMM: a morphology simulator and generator
This repo aims to construct a morphology generator by training a deep neural network based autoencoder (DNNAE), and simulate new samples by feeding randomly generated features into the decoder subnet. The Gaussian mixture models are estimated for generating the new feature vectors. 

## Construction of the package
In summary, we provide classes for constructing the DNNAE network as well as some utilities for image preprocessing, network saving and restoration, and etc. The users can build their own network with mean squared error (MSE), cross entropy (CE), or combine them. Batch normalization and dropout techniques are also good spices. Detailed instruction and usage please refer to the code files.

Notebooks are provided as demos for the user to construct their own DNNAE networks, which are 
- [notebook-dnnae-mnist](https://github.com/myinxd/dnnae-gmm/blob/master/demo-mnist/notebook-dnnae-mnist.ipynb): A DNNAE network for mnist hand-written digits simulation;
- [notebook-dnnae-mnist-restore](https://github.com/myinxd/dnnae-gmm/blob/master/demo-mnist/notebook-dnnae-mnist-restore.ipynb): Restore the trained network;
- [notebook-dnnae-mnist-gmm.ipynb](https://github.com/myinxd/dnnae-gmm/blob/master/demo-mnist/notebook-dnnae-mnist-gmm.ipynb): Generate new handwritten images.

## Requirements
Some python packages should be installed before applying the nets, which are listed as follows,
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org/)
- [tensorflow-gpu](http://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)

Also, [CUDA](http://develop.nvidia.org/cuda) is required if you want to run the codes by GPU, a Chinese guide for CUDA installation on Ubuntu 16.04 is [here](http://www.mazhixian.me/2017/12/13/Install-tensorflow-with-gpu-library-CUDA-on-Ubuntu-16-04-x64/).

## Usage
Before constructing a DNNAE net, the package should be installed. Here is the installation steps,
```sh
$ cd rcag-gmm
$ pip3 install --user .
```
Detailed usage of our dnnae-gmm package is demonstrated in [demo-mnist](https://github.com/myinxd/dnnae-gmm/blob/master/demo-mnist/) by jupyter notebooks. Below are examples of handwritten digits generated by the DNNAE above.
